# STATE — what's happening now

The single living state document for this repository. It is a snapshot, not a changelog; completed
history lives in git and durable reasoning lives in ADRs.

_Last updated: 2026-07-11 — adopted the closed docs and agent-context pipeline._

## Current status

Version 2.1.0 is published with editor themes, indent guides, syntax highlighting, and free
cross-function search. The codebase is stable on `main`; no product implementation is currently in
flight.

## Status table

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Editor enhancements | done | Themes, indent guides, and syntax highlighting are shipped. |
| Cross-function search | done | Search and native-editor handoff shipped in 2.1.0. |
| Agent context | done | Closed docs taxonomy, ADR log, living state, and guardrails are installed. |
| Rare Zoho surfaces | in-progress | Editor mount/settings selectors and less common overlays still need observation as they appear. |

## In flight

- Nothing in flight.

## Blocked

- Nothing blocked.

## Next

1. Run a focused live-org regression pass when changing cross-function search or its undocumented
   Zoho endpoints and globals.
2. Capture and cover rare editor overlays only when live evidence exposes an unthemed or fragile
   surface.

## How to update this doc

At the end of each session, update only the rows or sections the work changed. Move completed work
out of "In flight," keep "Next" concrete, and prune finished history. During parallel work, keep
edits section-local; if `STATE.md` conflicts during a merge, preserve both branches' current facts.

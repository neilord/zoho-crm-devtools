# STATE — what's happening now

The single living state document for this repository. It is a snapshot, not a changelog; completed
history lives in git and durable reasoning lives in ADRs.

_Last updated: 2026-09-11 — early ZUG campaign analytics reviewed; digest request closed._

## Current status

Version 2.2.0 is merged to `main` and published on the Chrome Web Store (listing checked September 8): the
function-search dashboard preview renders Deluge with syntax highlighting via an own
dependency-free tokenizer (see ADR 0005), using Zoho's native light palette; verified live in an
authenticated org. It supersedes 2.1.0. No product
implementation is in flight.

## Status table

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Editor enhancements | done | Themes, indent guides, and syntax highlighting are shipped. |
| Cross-function search | done | Search and native-editor handoff shipped in 2.1.0. |
| Dashboard preview highlighting | done | Own Deluge tokenizer highlights the `fs-code` preview using Zoho's native light palette (ADR 0005). Shipping in 2.2.0. Theme-following deferred to a later release (needs the observed editor theme persisted first). |
| Agent context | done | Closed docs taxonomy, ADR log, living state, and guardrails are installed. |
| Rare Zoho surfaces | in-progress | Editor mount/settings selectors and less common overlays still need observation as they appear. |

## In flight

- Growth planning: reviewed the authenticated GA4 listing-acquisition reports and Chrome Web
  Store developer metrics. A private task report proposes search-led positioning, partner/trainer
  distribution, practical tutorials, and a capped paid experiment toward 1,000 store users.
  Detailed account analytics remain outside the public repository. The September 9–10 ZUG campaign
  produced a clear listing-visitor spike and one directly attributed install event; the result is
  preliminary until the attribution window settles. The developer-dashboard session required fresh
  authentication, so installed-user growth remains unverified. Next: recheck the completed campaign
  window and installed-user trend, then prioritize the first distribution experiment. Store
  visitors, reported installs, installed users, and actual feature usage remain separate measures.
- Community outreach: introductions are published in both the Admins and Developers ZUG spaces.
  The [Admins post](posts/2026-09-09-admins-zug-search-all-functions.md) is retained locally; the
  Developers post URL/final copy has not yet been recorded. Zoho confirmed that its weekly
  Community Digest and monthly Developer Community Digest exclude third-party tools, including
  free and Marketplace-approved tools. Continue relevant disclosed participation under ADR 0006.
  Next Zoho-owned opportunities to validate are an educational Developer Hangout, ZUG meetup
  sponsorship, and eligibility for Zoho One's browser-extension catalog. ADR 0003 still prohibits
  per-release Forum topics.

## Blocked

- Nothing blocked.

## Next

1. Ship the deferred theme-following for the preview: persist the observed Zoho editor theme
   (light/dark) and any selected custom theme, then source the preview palette from
   `--zcdt-theme-editor-*` so it matches the active editor (announced as a follow-up feature).
2. Run a focused live-org regression pass when changing cross-function search or its undocumented
   Zoho endpoints and globals.
3. Capture and cover rare editor overlays only when live evidence exposes an unthemed or fragile
   surface.

## How to update this doc

At the end of each session, update only the rows or sections the work changed. Move completed work
out of "In flight," keep "Next" concrete, and prune finished history. During parallel work, keep
edits section-local; if `STATE.md` conflicts during a merge, preserve both branches' current facts.
